### 0. What is cloud service? 

When most people use the term *cloud* they often referred to *public cloud*, which is a service for renting compute and storage resources bundled with certain level of management. 

Traditionally, when we want to run an application that can be accessible from the internet, we have to have a physical computer that connecting to the internet with static public IP. This model is called *on-premise*.


I love to share my own analogy.  
    
When traveling, if I use the metro or bus, I share these vehicles with other people. This model is extremely successful because, generally, when we share a resource, it becomes way cheaper and more efficient when certain existing resources match your demand. We donâ€™t have to think about maintaining a car. This is the same for computing resources.

However, the metro and bus go to only certain locations at certain times. This can be compared with *provider-managed services* or the *serverless* model. All responsibility for managing and maintaining the infrastructure goes to the cloud provider, but this comes with a trade-off of less flexibility for customization. If we rent a car for a month, we can go anywhere we want and use it however we like. This is similar to using *infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)*, where we have more control and flexibility, but we are also responsible for managing and maintaining the resources ourselves.
